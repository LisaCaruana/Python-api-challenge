### Part I Analysis:
##3 observable trends for query date January 28, 2021:

1. There is no apparent relationship between temperature, humidity, and cloudiness.
2. There is an inverse relationship between max temp and latitude, with max temp
decreasing as latitude increases.
3. Winter temperatures in the Northern hemisphere and summer temperatures in the 
Southern hemisphere are clearly displayed in the shape of the City Latitude vs. Max Temperature 
graph. While temperatures around the 0 degrees latitude (the equator) remain consistently high, the long tail
on the right side of the graph indicates a steep drop in temperatures as you move up in
latitude and north from the equator to where the Earth is tilted away from the sun, causing winter. In contrast, warmer temperatures on the left
side of the graph can be seen even in latitudes far from the equator as the Earth's tilt on its axis means this hemisphere is facing the
sun, bringing warmer summer temperatures even as you move away from the equator.
